# RailBow

RailBow features a selection tool, found in shortcuts or by default bound to "ALT + Y".

With this tool you select rails and signals, and it will then automagically place tiles aroud the rails to make pretty patterns.

You can change the tiles to be placed in the configuration GUI found by pressing the rainbow button in the upper left corner.
